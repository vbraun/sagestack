## Configuration file for Hashdist

## All relative paths are relative to the directory containing this
## configuration file.

## Where to store the built software

build_stores:
 - dir: cache/builds


## Location where temporary directories for building software are created.
## Such directories are by default removed again once the build is done.

build_temp: tmp/build


## Locations of downloaded tarballs and git repositories.  A location
## can either be a local filesystem, or a URL to an online, read-only
## mirror. Only the first location, which should be a local directory,
## will be written to.

source_caches:
 - dir: cache/upstream

## For additional source cache mirror:
## - url: https://some.server.org/hashdist/src


## The cache directory is used for misc. caching (e.g., probing of host
## system).  The contents can always be wiped without resulting in rebuilds.

cache: tmp/cache

## The roots directory contains links to (links to) profiles. Anything
## pointed to through here will not be deleted when garbage-collected.

gc_roots: cache/gc_roots
