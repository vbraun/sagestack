== Description ==

Mercurial is a free, distributed source control management tool. It
offers you the power to efficiently handle projects of any size while
using an intuitive interface. It is easy to use and hard to break,
making it ideal for anyone working with versioned files.

== Changelog ==

=== mercurial-2.2.2.p0 (Jeroen Demeyer, 28 June 2012) ===
 * Trac #13175: upgrade to mercurial-2.2.2.
 * Remove xcode.patch, which got upstreamed.
 * Rename posix.py.patch to etc_mercurial.patch; keep the spirit of
   the old patch but patch a different source file.
 * Don't delete python/python2.6 and python/python in $SAGE_LOCAL/lib,
   this is handled by the Python spkg.

=== mercurial-1.8.4.p1 (Jeroen Demeyer, 23 February 2012) ===
 * Trac #12570: completely remove the XCode check, as it breaks with
   XCode 4.3.  This check was not needed anyway because of the changes
   in #12416.

=== mercurial-1.8.4.p0 (Jeroen Demeyer, 2 February 2012) ===
 * Trac #12416: add backported upstream patch "xcode.patch" to fix
   building Mercurial on systems where XCode is installed, but where
   the "gcc" found in the PATH isn't XCode's gcc.
 * Use "patch" for patching.

=== mercurial-1.8.4  (Keshav Kini, 2011-06-13) ===
 * Upgrade Mercurial to version 1.8.4
 * Add some useful default configuration settings
 * Remove obsolete hgmerge-osx patch since Mercurial has provided an autodetect
   configuration file for a few versions now

=== mercurial-1.7.3  (Ryan Grout, January 11, 2010) ===
 * Updated to Mercurial 1.7.3
 * Updated posix.py (patched against 1.7.3)

=== mercurial-1.6.4.p0  (Jeroen Demeyer, Leif Leonhardy, November 2nd, 2010) ===
 * Updated to Mercurial 1.6.4
 * Remove patch for setup.py, since that file now claims the following:
   "In any case, if it fails to build the error will be skipped ('optional')."
 * Major spkg-install clean-up:
   - Remove useless code.
   - Quote all instances of $SAGE_ROOT / $SAGE_LOCAL.
   - Test more exit codes (of 'cp' etc.).
   - Use CFLAG64 (if set).
   - Don't overwrite user-specified C[XX]FLAGS (if SAGE64=yes).
   - Use -z instead of = "".
   - Use "$UNAME" instead of `uname`.
   - Cosmetic changes (formatting, comments, messages etc.)
 * Added missing sections to SPKG.txt.

=== mercurial-1.3.1.p2  (David Kirkby, 21st May 2010) ===
 * #9009 Mercurial is not building 64-bit with OpenSolaris with SAGE64=yes.
   This just removes the condition the operating system needs to be OS X for
   a 64-bit build.

=== mercurial-1.3.1.p1  ???????????             ===
 * Changes occurrences of $RM to 'rm', $CP to 'cp' and similar.
   Failure to do so may result in conflicts with #7818

=== mercurial-1.3.1.p0  ???????????             ===

=== mercurial-1.3.1 (John Palmieri, 2009-09-08) ===
 * Updated to Mercurial 1.3.1
 * Moved a patch from "util.py" to "posix.py".
 * In spkg-install, removed the line "perl -p -i -e ..." because it has no
   effect: there are no files matching the pattern src/templates/*.tmpl,
   and the template files src/templates/*/*.tmpl don't contain the
   string ">manifest<".
 * In spkg-install, before the line "$CP patches/hgmerge-osx "$SAGE_LOCAL"/bin/hgmerge",
   added 'cd "$CUR" ' -- otherwise this command has no effect.

=== mercurial-1.01.p2 (William Stein, Nov 3, 2008) ===
 * Added custom hgmerge script for OS X. For some reason no script at all was
   copied over, which lead to (1) hg merge silently failing painfully for most
   users, and (2) for users that run install_scripts, they would get a fork
   bomb, since hgmerge would call sage -hgmerge which would call hgmerge
   ad infintum.

=== mercurial-1.01.p1 (Michael Abshoff, August 15th, 2008) ===
 * Disable inotify extenion since it is broken on Itanium

=== mercurial-1.01.p0 (Mike Hansen, July 21st, 2008) ===
 * Upgraded to Mercurial 1.01

=== mercurial-0.9.5.p1 (Michael Abshoff, May 22nd, 2008) ===
 * add 64 bit OSX build support

=== mercurial-0.9.5.p0 (Michael Abshoff, Dev. 19th, 2007) ===
 * put relevant files in newly created hg repo
 * updated SPKG.txt :)
 * remove $SAGE_LOCAL/lib/python[2.5] dead links (#1175)

=== mercurial-0.9.5 (Carl Witty, Oct. 20th, 2007) ===
 * Upgraded to mercurial 0.9.5.
 * Modified mercurial/util.py to skip looking in /etc/mercurial .

=== 20070106 (William Stein) ===
 * Modified mercurial/util.py to more intelligently choose the encoding, since this was crashing the install on my sage.math chroot jail.
 * no changes from default repo, except that there's a sage subdirectory with a better .css file that gets copied to templates/static during the install.  And another that gets copied to templates/.
 * Ran this command in the templates directory: "replace ">manifest<" ">browse all files<" *.tmpl". I mean, it's *incredibly* unclear what the hecke the "manifest" button is supposed to do.
