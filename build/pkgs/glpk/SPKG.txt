= GLPK 4.42 =

== Description ==

The GLPK (GNU Linear Programming Kit) package is intended for solving
large-scale linear programming (LP), mixed integer programming (MIP),
and other related problems. It is a set of routines written in ANSI C
and organized in the form of a callable library.

GLPK supports the GNU MathProg modelling language, which is a subset of
the AMPL language.

The GLPK package includes the following main components:

 * primal and dual simplex methods
 * primal-dual interior-point method
 * branch-and-cut method
 * translator for GNU MathProg
 * application program interface (API)
 * stand-alone LP/MIP solver

== License ==

The GLPK package is GPL version 3.

== Changelog ==

=== glpk-4.44.p0 (Simon King, 10th December 2011) ==
 * #12131: Use --libdir, to make the package work on openSUSE.

== glpk-4.44 (Nathann Cohen, 5th July 2010) ==

 * Removed the patch/ directory which was only useful for backward
   compatibility (and had been for some time already), and updated
   consequently several files

=== glpk-4.44 (David Kirkby, 23rd June 2010) ===
 * Updated to the latest upstream code, version 4.44.
 * Added code to allow a 64-bit build on any platform.
   If SAGE64 is set to "yes", the compiler flag -m64 is added
   by default. That flag works with GCC and SunStudio, but not
   all compilers - IBM's compiler for AIX and HP's for HP-UX
   both use different flags to create a 64-bit build.
   If the compiler does not use -m64 for 64-bit builds, then
   the environment variable CFLAG64 can be set to indicate what
   flag gets added.
 * Added a file spkg-check so the self-test code is built.
   This includes code which will add the appropriate flag
   for 64-bit builds if the test procedures need code to be
   compiled. (Sometimes running 'make test' actually needs
   the compiler flags set properly, so I do it just in case.
   It appears to be unnecessary with this version of GLPK,
   but might with later releases.
 * Added the configure option --with-gmp which will speed up
   processing of large integers (see src/INSTALL)
 * Added the configure option --disable-static since there is
   no need to build static libraries. (see src/INSTALL)
 * Added the configure option --with-zlib. Adding this allows
   GLPK API routines and the stand-alone solver to read and
   write compressed data files performing compression and
   decompression "on the fly" (see src/INSTALL)
 * Removed linking of the 'ld' library in spkg-install, as the
   reason for it being added was not clear.
 * Corrected SPKG.txt to indicate this code is GPL 3.
   (see src/COPYING)
 * Added the ChangeLog section to the SPKG.txt file
 * Added zlib, python and mpir as dependencies in SPKG.txt
 * Checked that the configure script actually does configure
   properly, if not exits.
 * Checked that 'make' does build the code properly, if not exits.
 * Checked that 'make install' does actually install the library
 * Checked that running 'python setup.py install' does actually work.
   If this is not done, code can appear to install properly as it
   passes 'configure', 'make' and 'make install'. So unusually there
   are 4 cases where spkg-install can fail.
 * The 'patch' directory is left - I think this should be removed
   but I'll leave it to those that know the software better
   than me to mess with this.
