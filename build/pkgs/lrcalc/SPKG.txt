== Special Update/Build Instructions ==

 * The upstream package has several packaging problems and problems
   with the build system. Since these are not easily fixed at install
   time, instead src/ is patched directly. This is done by the script
   spkg-src and the patch patches/build.diff. So, whenever you update
   the sources, you should use/modify the spkg-src script.
