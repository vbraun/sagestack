== Description ==

IML is a free library of C source code which implements algorithms for
computing exact solutions to dense systems of linear equations over the
integers. IML is designed to be used with the ATLAS/BLAS library and
GMP bignum library.

Written in portable C, IML can be used on both 32-bit and 64-bit
machines. It can be called from C++.

== Dependencies ==
 * GMP/MPIR
 * ATLAS

== Special Update/Build Instructions ==

 * Various files should be made executable. Run spkg-src after
   extracting the sources to src/ to fix this.

=== Patches ===

 * blas_headers.patch: Add BLAS header files from GSL, needed in case
   ATLAS has not been installed.
 * build.patch: Made build scripts that work.
 * configure_default_cflags.patch: get rid of the following error
   during configure:
     ./configure: line 18624: -O3: command not found
 * examples.patch: Modified some of the examples.
 * memleak.patch: use mpz_set_ui instead of mpz_init_set_ui on mpz
   which is already allocated.
 * remove_repl.patch: Do not build/install src/repl at all, since it
   does nothing anyway and creating empty archives fails on OS X.
