 # Makefile for cubex by Eric
-# This Makefile was seriously broken. 
-# CC was set to g++. Since it was compiling C++ files, 
-# CXX should have been used. 
-# LINK was set to g++, so I changed that to LD
-# CFLAGS was set to -O2. I've removed that, so it can be set
-# in spkg-install. 
-# In any case, it should have been CXXFLAGS
-# LFLAGS and INCLUDES were both empty
